While previous work has largely explored how these locations can be reached, their selection, that is, the where, has received little attention so far. In this paper, we fill this gap and present the first comprehensive analysis of target selection methods for fuzzing. To this end, we examine papers from leading security and software engineering conferences, identifying prevalent methods for choosing targets. By modeling these methods as general scoring functions, we are able to compare and measure their efficacy on a corpus of more than 1,600 crashes from the OSS-Fuzz project. Our analysis provides new insights for target selection in practice: First, we find that simple software metrics significantly outperform other methods, including common heuristics used in directed fuzzing, such as recently modified code or locations with sanitizer instrumentation. Next to this, we identify language models as a promising choice for target selection. In summary, our work offers a new perspective on directed fuzzing, emphasizing the role of target selection as an orthogonal dimension to improve performance.},

The ability to automatically identify and prioritize bugs in patches is crucial to organizations seeking to defend against potential threats. Previous works, however only consider bug discovery on statement, function or file level. How one would apply them to patches in realistic scenarios remains unclear. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach leveraging an interprocedural patch graph representation and graph neural networks to analyze software patches for identifying and locating potential security vulnerabilities. We modify current state-of-the-art learning-based static analyzers to be applicable to patches and show that our patch-based vulnerability discovery method, a context and flow-sensitive learning-based model, has a more than increased detection performance, is twice as robust against concept drift after model deployment and is particularly better suited for analyzing large patches. In comparison, other methods already lose their efficiency when a patch touches more than five methods.},

In particular, recent learning-based large transformer networks have shown remarkably high performance in various vulnerability detection and localization benchmarks. However, these models have also been shown to have difficulties accurately locating the root cause of flaws and generalizing to out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we investigate this problem and identify spurious correlations as the main obstacle to transferability and generalization, resulting in performance losses of up to 30\% for current models. We propose a method to measure the impact of these spurious correlations on learning models and estimate their true, unbiased performance. We present several strategies to counteract the underlying confounding bias, but ultimately our work highlights the limitations of evaluations in the laboratory for complex learning tasks such as vulnerability discovery.},

                                abstract=&quot;The automated discovery of vulnerabilities at scale is a crucial area of research in software security. While numerous machine learning models for detecting vulnerabilities are known, recent studies show that their generalizability and transferability heavily depend on the quality of the training data. Due to the scarcity of real vulnerabilities, available datasets are highly imbalanced, making it difficult for deep learning models to learn and generalize effectively. Based on the fact that programs can inherently be represented by graphs and to leverage recent advances in graph neural networks, we propose a novel method to generate synthetic code graphs for data augmentation to enhance vulnerability discovery. Our method includes two significant contributions: a novel approach for generating synthetic code graphs and a graph-to-code transformer to convert code graphs into their code representation. Applying our augmentation strategy to vulnerability discovery models achieves the same originally reported F1-score with less than {\$}{\$}20{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}20{\%}of the original dataset and we outperform the F1-score of prior work on augmentation strategies by up to {\$}{\$}25.6{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}25.6{\%}in detection performance.&quot;,
